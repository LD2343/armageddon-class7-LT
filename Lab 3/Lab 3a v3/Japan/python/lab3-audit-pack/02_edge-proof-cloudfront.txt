02 — EDGE PROOF (CLOUDFRONT)
===========================

STATUS
------
NOT APPLICABLE

RATIONALE
---------
CloudFront edge caching is not used in this deployment for the storage or processing of regulated data.

This system relies on regional Amazon S3 buckets for object storage, and CloudFront is not configured to cache or persist PHI at edge locations.

As a result, edge cache behavior evidence is not applicable to this architecture.

AUDITOR NOTE
------------
This file is intentionally retained to preserve audit pack numbering and control coverage alignment.
